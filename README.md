# HotspotEcommerceShop
HotspotShop enables you to buy and sell products on a global scale, twenty-four hours a day without incurring the same overheads as you would with running a brick and mortar store. For the best marketing mix and the best conversion rate, an Ecommerce venture should also have a physical presence. This is better known as a brick and mortar store.
